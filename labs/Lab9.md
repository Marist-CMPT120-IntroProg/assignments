# Lab Activity #9 â€“ More OOP Practice

## Goals

The goal of this lab time is to continue practicing defining and using classes and objects.

## Preparation

Create a new `Lab9` subfolder within your work repository. Then create a new Python source file in this folder and name it `books.py`.

## Instructions

In your `books.py` class, define a class named `Book` that will represent a book we might sell at an online bookseller.

1. Write a constructor/initializer. Books should have at least a title, author, publication year, and number of pages.
2. Write _observer_ (i.e., "getter") methods for all the fields.
3. Write a _mutator_ (i.e., "setter") methods for all the fields.
4. Write your own version of the `__str__` method  that returns a string representation of a book like this, "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, 1937 (310 pages)".
5. Write a `main` function that instantiates your `Book` class and tests its methods.
    - Use a loop to get book information to create `Book` instances and put them into a list.
    - Then, loop through the list and print all the books.
6. Test yoru program.
7. Commit and push your work.

## Completing this Lab

In order to receive full credit for this Lab activity:

1. The `Lab9` subfolder of your repository must contain at least one Python script named `books.py` that meets the requirements above.
2. Your repository's commit history must show at least one commit reflecting your changes for this Python file.
3. All of the above must be pushed to GitHub so that I can see it.
